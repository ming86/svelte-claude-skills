description: Svelte 5 runes guidance. Use for reactive state, props, effects, or Svelte 4→5 migration. Covers $state, $derived, $effect, $props, $bindable. Prevents mixing syntaxes and reactivity mistakes.

# Svelte 5 Runes

## Quick Start

**Which rune?** Props: `$props()` | Bindable: `$bindable()` |
Computed: `$derived()` | Side effect: `$effect()` | State: `$state()`

**Key rules:** Runes are top-level only. $derived is read-only. Don't
mix Svelte 4/5 syntax. Objects/arrays are shallow reactive.

## Example

```svelte
<script>
	let count = $state(0); // Mutable state
	let doubled = $derived(count * 2); // Computed (read-only)

	$effect(() => {
		console.log(`Count is ${count}`); // Side effect
	});
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	{count} (doubled: {doubled})
</button>
```
